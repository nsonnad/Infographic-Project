        <p>NEW YORK—New data collected earlier this year from migrants traveling through northwest Bosnia shows the persistent violence migrants experience crossing borders in Europe, in particular during illegal pushbacks conducted by Croatian border forces, allegations Croatian officials <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/oct/23/croatia-denies-migrant-border-attacks-after-new-reports-of-brutal-pushbacks">continually deny</a>.</p>
      </div>
        <p>The results of the data are glaring: 93% percent of migrants surveyed reported that they had experienced some form of violence from border guards along their journey. The most common methods were beatings with a club or stick, psychological harassment or intimidation, and simple beatings with hands or feet.<p>
        <p>“This data corroborates what many people along the Balkan route have been saying for years — that state violence is pervasive on their journeys,” says Jack Sapoch, who worked for the Border Violence Monitoring Network (BVMN), a watchdog organization, until earlier this year. Sapoch and other advocates have <a href="https://ecre.org/bvmn-report-on-illegal-pushbacks-and-border-violence-in-the-balkan-region-2/">long argued</a> that such pushbacks are systematic, designed by Europe governments to keep asylum-seekers out.</p>

            <p>Large populations of refugees live in Bosnian towns along the so-called ‘Balkan Route’ while they prepare to cross the border into EU member state Croatia. The area has seen tens of thousands of refugees pass through in recent years to final destinations in Western Europe. Authorities logged <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/short_news/twice-as-many-illegal-migrants-along-balkan-route-this-year/">14,734 attempts</a> to cross borders in the Balkans in the first five months of 2021, an increase of 104% from the same period last year.</p>
            <p>This summer, a total of 159 migrants completed a survey on topics ranging from access to medical care, sleep patterns, dental history and more. The survey was professionally translated into the four most common languages migrants in the area speak: Farsi/Dari, Urdu, Arabic and Bengali.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>The survey asked migrants to express which, if any, forms of violence they had experienced at the hands of border authorities on their journeys across Europe. (The exact wording of the question in English can be found below.)</p>
        <p>Migrants tend to experience the worst forms of violence during pushbacks, when border authorities return them over a border back to the country from which they just came. The Geneva Convention, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the UN Convention Against Torture all contain provisions that make these pushbacks illegal.</p>
        <p>Croatian authorities have consistently denied they conduct systematic pushbacks on the border.</p>
        <p>“The persistent portrayal of the Croatian police as a brutal and inhumane group prone to robberies and abuse of illegal migrants has now become commonplace without a single [piece of] evidence,” the Croatian Ministry of Interior told the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/apr/07/croatian-border-police-accused-of-sexually-assaulting-afghan-migrant"><i>Guardian</i></a> earlier this year.</p>
        <p>The data suggest otherwise. The research complements the thousands of testimonies of migrant pushbacks collected by the Border Violence Monitoring Network since 2017. Last December, BVMN released the “Black Book of Pushbacks,” a 1,500-page catalogue of over 12,000 such testimonies across the Balkan region.</p>
        <p>What this new data provides, Sapoch says, is a more general overview of the situation for refugees along Europe’s borders.</p>
        <p>“Alongside direct physical violence, refugees and migrants encounter systems of material and psychological violence,” Sapoch points out. “This violence is made more efficient by new technologies financed by EU money, like thermal cameras, drones, heartbeat sensors, and helicopters.”</p>
        <p>Croatia receives millions of euros in funding each year from the EU to help guard its borders, spending the money on high-tech surveillance and tracking equipment as well as additional border personnel. This July, the European Commission <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/10/eu-new-evidence-of-systematic-unlawful-pushbacks-and-violence-at-borders/">awarded</a> the country a €14 million ($16.1 million) emergency funding grant. Although the EU is now <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-9-2020-003837_EN.html">demanding more transparency</a>, its own ombudsman has meanwhile <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/nov/10/inquiry-launched-into-eu-commissions-protection-of-migrants-at-croatia-border">launched an investigation</a> into the bloc’s complicity in the misuse of funds at the Croatian border.</p>
        <p>“It is alarming that the European Commission continues to turn a blind eye to the staggering violation of EU law, and even continues to finance police and border operations in some of these countries,” Jelena Sesar, an Amnesty International researcher for the Balkans, said in a <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/10/eu-new-evidence-of-systematic-unlawful-pushbacks-and-violence-at-borders/">press release</a> this week.</p>
        <p>Under scrutiny from Brussels, Croatia set up an independent border monitoring mechanism this year to review allegations of human rights violations. But leading advocacy organizations <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/08/02/croatia/eu-strengthen-border-monitoring-system&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1633568545368000&usg=AOvVaw02vsRyqzuU4N-3WTuFv_5l">say</a> Croatia's efforts are woefully inadequate.</p>
        <p>As Brussels and Croatia point fingers, the violence at the border continues. Sapoch says it’s important to remember that the violence of Europe’s borders comes in many forms.</p>
        <p>“Violence exists within torture and electric weaponry like tasers, but it also exists within the containment strategy that keep people cramped in places like Lipa or Miral [two refugee camps in northwest Bosnia], only for them to catch fire. Violence exists in the desperation that leads pushback victims to start self-medicating with pills and alcohol to help them cope with their trauma,” Sapoch notes.</p>

        </ul>
        <h2>Snapshot of the border violence data:</h2>
          <p>The survey is divided into eleven sections. One of the sections is entitled, “Episodes of Violence on the Journey.” The first question of that section reads as follows:</p>
          <i><p>Since you left home, have you been the victim of any of these acts of violence at the hands of state actors (i.e. police, border officers, other authorities)?</p></i>
          <p>Participants were given the following options to choose from:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Attacked with a knife</li>
              <li>Victim of a gun shooting</li>
              <li>Attacked with a taser or electric weapon</li>
              <li>Hit with a club or a stick</li>
              <li>Engaged in a physical fight without weapons</li>
              <li>Tortured</li>
              <li>Physically harassed</li>
              <li>Psychologically intimidated or harassed</li>
              <li>Victim of sexual violence</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Out of 159 participants, <b>148 people (93%)</b> expressed being the victim of violence. Six reported no violence, and five people left the question blank.</p>
